    <h3>💌 The Love Letter 🤗💖</h3>
    <p>My dearest Dikshita 😘,</p>
    <p>Sometimes I look up at the sky and wonder how I ever got so lucky—how in this vast world, out of billions of souls, it was <em>you</em> who found me 💓. The girl with the softest heart, the sweetest laugh, the one who unknowingly became the <strong>center of my universe</strong> 🌸.</p>
    <p>From the very first time we talked on <strong>14th April 2025</strong> 🗓️, something inside me shifted. It was quiet, like a whisper from fate—but it was powerful. That day, unknowingly, my life started to change. With every word you spoke, every smile you shared 😊, I started seeing my future with you. Not in pieces—but whole. Complete. <em>Us</em> 💑.</p>
    <p>We've already seen such a beautiful life together, jaan 🥰. We've laughed through late-night calls, comforted each other in silence 🤗, made memories that feel like soft pages in a love story written just for us 📖💞. You’re not just my girlfriend—you’re my home, my peace, my purpose 🌷.</p>
    <p>And if this life is ours to share, I still say <strong>seven more would never be enough</strong> 💗💫.</p>
    <p><strong>I want you in the next 7 janams—and even then, meri laadu, I’ll still ask for more 💍💖.</strong></p>
    <p>I love you more than any word could ever hold 💬❤️, more than any poem could ever capture 📝💕. Every moment without you feels like a pause in time ⏳, and every second with you is a forever I never want to end ⌛💞.</p>
    <p>This is just a little letter, on a little website 🌐. But the love behind it? It’s infinite ♾️💝.</p>
    <div class="signature">Forever yours,<br/>Ritik (your hubby) 💗😘</div>

    <h3>📜 A Promise Across Janams 💞</h3>
    <p>In every life, I’ll find your face 😘,<br>
    In crowded worlds, in time and space 🌌.<br>
    Through birth and death, through joy and ache 💔,<br>
    My soul will know the path to take 💫.</p>
    <p>Your voice, my guide; your eyes, my prayer 🙏,<br>
    No heaven’s light could quite compare ✨.<br>
    For every dawn, in every hue 🌅—<br>
    My heart wakes up just chasing you 🥺❤️.</p>
    <p>So take my hand, let stars align 🌟,<br>
    Your heart is mine, and mine is thine 💖.<br>
    Seven lifetimes? That’s too few 💞.<br>
    I’d ask the universe for <em>infinite</em> you 💍💘.</p>
